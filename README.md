# HiFive Example Code
Example applications that run on a HiFive - SiFive's RISC-V-based, open-source, Arduino-compatible development board.
## Motion-Triggered Audio Message Player
A motion activated audio player, which plays an 11 KHz 12-bit uncompressed audio over an Arduino audio wave shield using a SPI interface that is triggered by a passive infrared sensor or a push button through a GPIO interface.

## Gas Pump Skimmer Scanner
In September 2017, Nathan Seidle at Sparkfun published a [great deep-dive article](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/gas-pump-skimmers) exploring how certain HC-05 Bluetooth gas pump skimmers worked. This project is inspired by that article, and demonstrates a fully-functioning Arduino-based skimmer scanner, using a HC-05 module connected via UART.
